How token-based authentication works
In token-based authentication, the client exchanges hard credentials (such as username and password) for a piece of data called token. For each request, instead of sending the hard credentials, the client will send the token to the server to perform authentication and then authorization.

In a few words, an authentication scheme based on tokens follow these steps:

The client sends their credentials (username and password) to the server.
The server authenticates the credentials and, if they are valid, generate a token for the user.
The server stores the previously generated token in some storage along with the user identifier and an expiration date.
The server sends the generated token to the client.
The client sends the token to the server in each request.
The server, in each request, extracts the token from the incoming request. With the token, the server looks up the user details to perform authentication.
If the token is valid, the server accepts the request.
If the token is invalid, the server refuses the request.
Once the authentication has been performed, the server performs authorization.
The server can provide an endpoint to refresh tokens.
Note: The step 3 is not required if the server has issued a signed token (such as JWT, which allows you to perform stateless authentication).
